                    My grandmother kisses <br>
                    as if bombs are bursting in the backyard, <br>
                    where mint and jasmine lace their perfumes <br>
                    through the kitchen window, <br>
                    as if somewhere, a body is falling apart <br>
                    and flames are making their way back <br>
                    through the intricacies of a young boy's thigh, <br>
                    as if to walk out the dor, your torso <br>
                    would dance from exit wounds. <br>
                    When my grandmother kisses, there would be <br>
                    no flashy smooching, no western music <br>
                    of pursed lips, she kisses as if to breathe <br>
                    you inside her, nose pressed to check <br>
                    so that your scent is relearned <br>
                    and your sweat pearls into drops of gold <br>
                    inside her lungs, as if while she holds you <br>
                    death also, is clutching your wrist. <br>
                    My grandmother kisses as if history <br>
                    never ended, as if somewhere <br>
                    a body is still <br>
                    falling apart. <br>

                <blockquote>
                    slides down into my body, soft<br>
                    lambs wool, what everybody<br>
                    in school is wearing and for me <br>
                    to have it my mother worked twenty <br>
                    hours at the fast-food joint. <br>
                    The sweater fits like a lover, <br>
                    sleeves snug, thin on the waist. <br>
                    As I run my fingers through the knit, <br>
                    I see my mother over the hot oil in the fryers<br>
                    dipping a strainer full of stringed potatoes.<br>
                    In a twenty hour period my mother waits on hundreds of customers: she pushes <br>
                    each order under ninety seconds, slaps <br>
                    the refried beans she mashed during prep time, <br>
                    the lull before rush hours, onto steamed tortillas, <br>
                    the room's pressing heat melting her make-up. <br>
                    How many buritos can one make in a continuous day? <br>
                    How many pounds of onions, lettuce and tomatoes <br>
                    pass through the slicer? How do her wrists <br>
                    sustain the scraping, lifting and flipping <br>
                    of meat patties?       And twenty<br>
                    hours are merely links <br>
                    in the chain of days startlingly similar, <br>
                    that begin in the blue morning with my mother <br>
                    putting on her polyester uniform, which, <br>
                    even when it's newly-washed, smells <br>
                    of mashed beans and cooked ground beef. <br>
